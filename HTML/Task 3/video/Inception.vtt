00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.605
No space to think
in that broom cupboard.

00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:09.714
Is it safe for you to be here?

00:00:08.954 --> 00:00:11.354
Extradition between France
and the United States...

00:00:11.523 --> 00:00:13.753
...is a bureaucratic nightmare,
you know that.

00:00:13.926 --> 00:00:16.656
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:21.323
Look, I, uh, brought these for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.094
It'll take more than
the occasional stuffed animal...

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.238
...to convince those children
they still have a father.

00:00:27.406 --> 00:00:30.239
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:31.933
I never taught you to be a thief.

00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:33.306
No, you taught me to navigate
people's minds.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.777
But after what happened...

00:00:34.948 --> 00:00:38.509
...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate
ways for me to use that skill.

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:46.146
What are you doing here, Dom?

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.660
I think I found a way home.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.390
It's a job
for some very, very powerful people.

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:59.036
People who I believe can fix
my charges permanently.

00:00:59.838 --> 00:01:01.100
But I need your help.

00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:05.106
You're here to corrupt
one of my brightest and best.

00:01:05.277 --> 00:01:08.178
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.

00:01:08.347 --> 00:01:09.814
- Money.
- Not just money.

00:01:09.982 --> 00:01:11.313
You remember.

00:01:11.483 --> 00:01:14.714
It's the chance to build cathedrals,
entire cities...

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:16.650
...things that never existed...

00:01:16.822 --> 00:01:20.019
...things that couldn't exist
in the real world.

00:01:20.192 --> 00:01:25.357
So you want me to let someone else
follow you into your fantasy?

00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:27.499
They don't actually come into the dream.

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:30.931
They just design the levels
and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

00:01:31.103 --> 00:01:32.331
Design it yourself.

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:36.497
Mal won't let me.

00:01:42.714 --> 00:01:44.841
Come back to reality, Dom.

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:48.745
- Please.
- Reality.

00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:51.646
Those kids, your grandchildren...

00:01:51.824 --> 00:01:55.817
...they're waiting for their father to come
back home. That's their reality.

00:01:55.994 --> 00:01:59.191
And this job, this last job,
that's how I get there.

00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:03.360
I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

00:02:06.538 --> 00:02:12.439
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

00:02:13.645 --> 00:02:16.636
I've got somebody better.
